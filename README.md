# MoureDev Weekly Challenges Solutions

This is a repository containing my solutions to the weekly challenges proposed by [@MoureDev](https://mouredev.com/) in his github [repo](https://github.com/mouredev/Weekly-Challenge-2022-Kotlin).

This are challenges design to practice and improve your coding ability with any language prefered. I used Javascript to complete each challenge.

ðŸš§ I'm still developing solutions for every challenge and new challenges are available every week. 
## Run Locally

1. Open a terminal and clone the project to your computer:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Bryanmartz972/mouredev-weekly-challenges.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd mouredev-weekly-challenges 
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

4. To execute the challenge either run the challenge in your terminal to receive the solution via terminal or execute the tests of the challenge. 



## Running Tests

To run all the tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm test
```

To run a specific test, run the following command

```bash
  npm test -- Challenge#.test.js
```
*(Replace the **#** with the number of the challenge you want to execute)*
